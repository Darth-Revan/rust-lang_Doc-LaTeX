An \enum\ in Rust is a type that represents data that is one of several possible variants. Each variant in the \enum\ can optionally 
have data associated with it:

\begin{rustc}
enum Message {
    Quit,
    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
}
\end{rustc}

The syntax for defining variants resembles the syntaxes used to define structs: you can have variants with no data (like unit-like 
structs), variants with named data, and variants with unnamed data (like tuple structs). Unlike separate struct definitions, however, 
an \enum\ is a single type. A value of the enum can match any of the variants. For this reason, an enum is sometimes called a 
'sum type': the set of possible values of the enum is the sum of the sets of possible values for each variant.

We use the \code{::} syntax to use the name of each variant: they're scoped by the name of the \enum\ itself. This allows both of 
these to work:

\begin{rustc}
let x: Message = Message::Move { x: 3, y: 4 };

enum BoardGameTurn {
    Move { squares: i32 },
    Pass,
}

let y: BoardGameTurn = BoardGameTurn::Move { squares: 1 };
\end{rustc}

Both variants are named \code{Move}, but since they're scoped to the name of the \enum\, they can both be used without conflict.

A value of an \enum\ type contains information about which variant it is, in addition to any data associated with that variant. This 
is sometimes referred to as a 'tagged union', since the data includes a 'tag' indicating what type it is. The compiler uses this 
information to enforce that you're accessing the data in the enum safely. For instance, you can't simply try to destructure a value 
as if it were one of the possible variants:

\begin{rustc}
fn process_color_change(msg: Message) {
    let Message::ChangeColor(r, g, b) = msg; // compile-time error
}
\end{rustc}

Not supporting these operations may seem rather limiting, but it's a limitation which we can overcome. There are two ways: by 
implementing equality ourselves, or by pattern matching variants with \code{match} expressions, which you'll learn in the next section 
(see \nameref{sec:syntax_match}). We don't know enough about Rust to implement equality yet, but we'll find out in the traits section 
(see \nameref{sec:syntax_traits}).

\subsection*{Constructors as functions}

An \enum\ constructor can also be used like a function. For example:

\begin{rustc}
let m = Message::Write("Hello, world".to_string());
\end{rustc}

is the same as

\begin{rustc}
fn foo(x: String) -> Message {
    Message::Write(x)
}

let x = foo("Hello, world".to_string());
\end{rustc}

This is not immediately useful to us, but when we get to closures (see \nameref{sec:syntax_closures}), we'll talk about passing 
functions as arguments to other functions. For example, with iterators (see \nameref{sec:effective_iterators}), we can do this to 
convert a vector of \String s into a vector of \code{Message::Writes}:

\begin{rustc}
let v = vec!["Hello".to_string(), "World".to_string()];

let v1: Vec<Message> = v.into_iter().map(Message::Write).collect();
\end{rustc}
