Note: intrinsics will forever have an unstable interface, it is recommended to use the stable interfaces of libcore rather 
than intrinsics directly.

These are imported as if they were FFI functions, with the special \code{rust-intrinsic} ABI. For example, if one was in a 
freestanding context, but wished to be able to \code{transmute} between types, and perform efficient pointer arithmetic, one 
would import those functions via a declaration like

\begin{rustc}
#![feature(intrinsics)]

extern "rust-intrinsic" {
    fn transmute<T, U>(x: T) -> U;

    fn offset<T>(dst: *const T, offset: isize) -> *const T;
}
\end{rustc}

As with any other FFI functions, these are always \code{unsafe} to call.
